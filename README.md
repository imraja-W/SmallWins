# 🧠 smallWins

This repo holds my daily Python practice, SQL, and Excel challenges — simple, small, and consistent.  
Every file is a tiny win, every line is progress. 🚀

## 💻 What's inside?

- **Python**: Beginner-level Python challenges  
  - Logic practice (if/else, loops, functions)  
  - Experimentation zone 👨‍🔬

- **SQL**: Starting from scratch and practicing basic SQL queries  
  - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE  
  - Joins, subqueries, and aggregation (COUNT, SUM, AVG)

- **Excel**: Learning Excel for data analysis  
  - Basic operations (formulas, pivot tables)  
  - Advanced functions (VLOOKUP, SUMIF, charts, data cleaning)

## 📅 Why "smallWins"?

Because every single day I get 1% better — and that’s all that matters.  
This is where I keep track of those baby steps that lead to big leaps.

## 🛠️ WIP

Still learning, still building. Don't expect perfection, expect growth. 💪
