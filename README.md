# 🧠 smallWins

This repo holds my daily Python practice — simple, small, and consistent.  
Every file is a tiny win, every line is progress. 🚀

## 💻 What's inside?

- Beginner-level Python challenges
- Logic practice (if/else, loops, functions)
- Experimentation zone 👨‍🔬

## 📅 Why "smallWins"?

Because every single day I get 1% better — and that’s all that matters.  
This is where I keep track of those baby steps that lead to big leaps.

## 🛠️ WIP

Still learning, still building. Don't expect perfection, expect growth. 💪
